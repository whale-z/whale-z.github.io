I am a second-year masterâ€™s student in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Northeastern University. Here, I work with Prof. [Zhenghao Liu](https://edwardzh.github.io/) on dense retrieval and multi-modal retrieval. 

My research interests include Natural Language Processing, Multimodal LLM and Information Retrieval.
